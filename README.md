try using dmi to do water from two rocks on datasets (look at Multi_model_learning.pdf to find some datasets)

use https://github.com/Justin1904/Low-rank-Multimodal-Fusion (ignore the text data) and https://github.com/Newbeeer/L_DMI to try it.(compare L_dmi loss function to the loss function given in water from two rocks)
